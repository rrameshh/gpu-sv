# SIMD GPU Architecture

A custom 2-core GPU implemented from scratch in SystemVerilog, demonstrating parallel processing and SIMD programming concepts.

## Features

- **2-core parallel architecture** with shared memory
- **4-instruction ISA**: LOAD, ADD, STORE, HALT
- **Simultaneous execution** of different data streams
- **Cycle-accurate simulation** with performance metrics

## Quick Start

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_sim.sh
./scripts/run_sim.sh
